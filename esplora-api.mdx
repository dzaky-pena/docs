title: Esplora API
---

The Esplora API is a RESTful service designed by [Blockstream](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora) that provides a lightweight and efficient HTTP interface for accessing Bitcoin data including blocks, transactions and addresses.

Esplora is designed for performance and ease of integration, making it ideal for explorers, wallets, and backend services that need fast blockchain reads without running a full node RPC server.

The Maestro Esplora API offers a forked [Mempool.Space](https://github.com/mempool/mempool) instance, with support for both Bitcoin mainnet and Bitcoin testnet4.
