- **Annual billing savings:** Get an additional 30% discount by choosing annual billing
- **No infrastructure costs:** Eliminate the expenses of running and maintaining your own blockchain nodes
- **Developer efficiency:** Reduce development time and costs by using our ready-made APIs instead of building custom solutions

For many projects, using Maestro is significantly more economical than building and maintaining comparable blockchain infrastructure in-house, especially when accounting for ongoing operational costs and the specialized expertise required.

***

## Q27: How do Maestro's volume discounts work?

**A:** Maestro's pricing is designed to reward growth. As your API usage increases, you automatically qualify to higher volume tiers with progressively larger discounts. This ensures your costs don't scale linearly with your success. The volume discounts apply automatically based on your monthly usage, making the unit price cheaper the more you use it.

***
