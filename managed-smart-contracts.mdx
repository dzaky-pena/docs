# Smart-Contract Marketplace

Maestro has released Cardano's first Smart Contract Marketplace, a repository of open-source and audited smart contracts contributed by the community. This platform is a significant step toward promoting open collaboration and trust within the smart contract landscape.

In addition, Maestro offers two novel services aimed at empowering developers with low-code/no-code tools to build and deploy secure dApps easily.

1. Managed Contract API: Deploy contracts and build transactions with a simple REST API interface
2. Contract UI Widgets: Integrate whitelabel React components directly into your app


<Warning>
This service is only included in subscriptions above the **Artist** tier.

### Contract Royalty

Royalties are directly encoded into the contract and *automatically distributed to the contract author* when executed. Like NFT royalties, this ensures the author is incentivized to **open-source** their contract and is rewarded accordingly, *benefiting the Cardano ecosystem with standardized and vetted contracts* for anyone to use.

**Add your own contract to the Marketplace**

Do you have a smart contract and want to earn royalties for it?

<Note>
To get added to the *Marketplace*, follow the following ***Contribution Instructions.***

## Advantages of Open-Sourcing Contracts

- **Standardization**: Open-source contracts can demonstrate best practices and battle-tested protocol architectures, providing a reliable foundation for developers.
- **Security**: Anyone can audit open-source contracts, enhancing their security over time and building confidence in the community that uses them.
- **Collaboration**: Open-source work benefits from diverse contributions, which can lead to higher application efficiency and robustness.
- **Composability**: The ability to combine and recombine contracts encourages creative and innovative protocol development.

***

## Unlocked Benefits for Cardanoâ€™s dApp Ecosystem

1. **Dependable Contracts**: Access a curated collection of modular, robust, and reusable smart contracts. Benefit from contracts that have undergone rigorous community assessments.
2. **Standardize Contract Interface**: Interact with contracts through intuitive API, SDK, or UI components, lowering the barrier to entry into Web3 and unlocking the power of blockchain for everyone.
3. **Instant Deployment**: Avoid cumbersome and expensive Cardano backend infrastructure and seamlessly deploy contracts into your web2 application.
4. **Rewarding Innovation**: The royalty system for **both** the backend and frontend developers encourages a culture of sharing and collective advancement.

## Managed Contract API

Maestro's Managed Contracts API gives access to **ready-to-deploy smart contracts** written in [Plutus](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus) and [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/) or any other Cardano smart contract frameworks. The contract API abstracts away both *on-chain* and *off-chain* script interactions. Using intuitive and developer-friendly endpoints, this fully managed contract service aims to *enhance developer experience*, *strengthen the ecosystem*, and *enhance the security* of Dapps on Cardano.

## Contract UI Widgets

### *Direct Swap UI Widget*

For those looking for an end-to-end web integration, Maestro's Contract Widgets provide a no-code option, allowing developers to add full-featured frontend components to any website. All UI widgets are made open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/maestro-org/smart-contract-clients):

**Add your own UI Widget and charge a frontend fee**

Similar to smart contract royalties, front-end developers can contribute their own UI component and charge a *front-end fee* to receive ongoing revenue for their work.

### *Linear Vesting UI Widget*
