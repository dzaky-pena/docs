Maestro’s Market Price API delivers real-time, rollback-protected DEX trading activity alongside historical price mapping for both Bitcoin and Rune assets in USD. It combines deep network-level indexing with robust trade tracking, abstracting away the complexity of UTXO handling.

## Key Features:
* **Mempool Awareness:** Provides insight into the latest trades from the mempool for the most dynamic price discovery.
* **Rollback Protection:** Ensures price accuracy by tracking chain reorganizations and updating data accordingly—no stale or orphaned block data.
* **Dual-Pipeline Indexing:** Separately indexes UTXOs and trades for accuracy and real-time responsiveness.
* **Real-Time DEX Price Feeds:** Continuously updated trade and price data, optimized for wallets, traders, and analytics platforms.
* **Historical Price Mapping:** Access time-series price data (USD) for both Bitcoin and Rune assets, enabling historical analysis and charting.

## Key Benefits for Developers:
* Track accurate, chain-verified prices without maintaining your own indexers.
* Build DEX-integrated wallets and apps with reliable, real-time market signals.
* Identify and act on price trends immediately, with confidence the data won’t be invalidated by reorgs.
