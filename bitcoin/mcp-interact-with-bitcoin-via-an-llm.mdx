title: "MCP: Interact with Bitcoin via an LLM"
---

<Info>
    The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools.

    For additional information about MCP, its origins, and [Claude](https://claude.ai), read more from the creators, [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).

***

The <a href="https://github.com/maestro-org/maestro-mcp-server" target="_blank">Maestro MCP server</a> allows for interacting with Bitcoin through the interface of an LLM client.

Maestro MCP transforms how LLMs engage with the Bitcoin network, turning them into powerful, on-chain agents. Bridging Claude (or any LLM client) with our MCP server enables the LLM to query blocks, inspect transactions, analyze addresses, and even take action on behalf of the user.

This server functionality provides the LLM with a set of tools for exploring blocks, transactions, addresses, and other aspects of the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing the LLM to not only retrieve and make infereances on on-chain data, but also to take action on behalf of the user; ie, serve as an [*agent*](https://github.com/resources/articles/ai/what-are-ai-agents).

In this tutorial, we will use <a href="https://claude.ai/download" target="_blank">Claude Desktop</a> client alongside the **hosted** Maestro MCP server to communicate with the Bitcoin network and start making intelligent, on-chain requests.&#x20;

*For more client examples, see our *<a href="https://github.com/maestro-org/maestro-mcp-client-examples" target="_blank">Maestro MCP client examples repo</a>* and refer to our *<a href="https://github.com/maestro-org/maestro-mcp-client-examples/tree/main/examples/claude#local" target="_blank">local setup</a>* if you'd like to understand how to connect Claude Desktop to a locally-running MCP server.*

<Warning>
    Some of the MCP server functionality will not work if you are using the **Artist tier**; a **Composer-level subscription or higher** will be needed to access the more advanced MCP features, such as those related to Mempool API activities.

    Consult the [pricing page](https://www.gomaestro.org/pricing) for more information.

<Note>
    Be sure to replace the `<MAESTRO_API_KEY` with your generated API and that the key you generate matches the network you are looking to connect with.

    **Hosted Mainnet:** [https://xbt-mainnet.gomaestro-api.org/v0/mcp](https://xbt-mainnet.gomaestro-api.org/v0/mcp)
    
    **Hosted Testnet4:** [*https://xbt-testnet.gomaestro-api.org/v0/mcp*](https://xbt-testnet.gomaestro-api.org/v0/mcp)
</Note>

```json claude_desktop_config.json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "maestro-mcp-server": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "mcp-remote",
                "https://xbt-mainnet.gomaestro-api.org/v0/mcp",
                "--header",
                "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}",
                "--transport",
                "http-only"
            ],
            "env": {
                "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer <MAESTRO_API_KEY>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
