Maestro's Bitcoin Wallet API delivers detailed transaction activity data at the address level, spanning native Bitcoin (satoshis) and metaprotocol layers like inscriptions and runes. This API enables deep visibility into balance changes, token movements, and asset-specific behaviors. Useful for powering explorers, wallets, or dashboards with granular insight into address-level history and asset interactions.

## Key Features:
* **Satoshi Activity Tracking:** Track and analyze satoshi-level balance changes—including increases, decreases, and self-transfers—with timestamped precision. Historical balances are itemized by either block height or timestamp, enabling accurate auditing, time-based analysis, and USD-denominated valuation over time.
* **Inscription Insight:** Monitor Ordinals transactions, filtered by inscription ID, activity type (send/receive), or self-transfer logic to reduce noise from spam or internal moves.
* **Rune Transaction Logging:** Track rune minting, transfers, etchings, and balance changes for a given address, including support for filtering by specific rune.
* **Unified Metaprotocol View:** Fetch combined activity across satoshis, inscriptions, and runes in a single request to power holistic user or address histories.
* **Mempool Awareness:** Provides insight into the latest activity from the mempool by default. The system monitors for block reorganizations and automatically rolls back unconfirmed or invalidated trades, ensuring the data reflects the confirmed state of the chain.

## Key Benefits for Developers:

Developers gain the ability to surface address-level insights without having to manually parse raw blockchain data. The Wallet API simplifies historical activity analysis, enables protocol-specific filtering, and lets developers build UX-enhancing features like transaction history views, asset trackers, and real-time alerts for wallet activity without managing indexing infrastructure.
