title: Bitcoin - Node RPC API
sidebarTitle: Overview
---

This API offers direct, low-latency access to Bitcoin full nodes via API (JSON-RPC protocol), giving developers reliable mempool visibility, transaction relay capabilities, and chain data without the hassle of running their own infrastructure.

## Key Features:

* **Full JSON-RPC Support:** Access core Bitcoin functionality through RPC calls like getblock, getrawtransaction, sendrawtransaction, etc.
* **Blockchain Data Retrieval:** Developers can fetch detailed information about blocks, transactions, and addresses.
* **Mempool Insight:** Query unconfirmed transactions for faster, more responsive, real-time data access.
* **High-Availability:** Enterprise-grade infrastructure ensures uptime, sync accuracy and fast transaction relay.

## Key Benefits for Developers:

* Skip the operational complexity and computational overhead of maintaining self-hosted Bitcoin nodes.
* Query mempool and chain data to power wallets, explorers, and backends with minimal latency.
* Broadcast and verify transactions with trusted relay endpoints.
* Build production-ready Bitcoin apps without worrying about node health, bandwidth, or reorg handling.
