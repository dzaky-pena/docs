The [**Dogecoin blockchain**](https://dogecoin.com/) is a decentralized digital currency network that supports peer-to-peer transactions. It uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin but features quicker block times and a more abundant supply. Originally created as a “meme” cryptocurrency, Dogecoin has gained a large community following and a notable market presence.
