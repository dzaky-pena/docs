title: Blockchain Indexer
---

A blockchain indexer is a key piece of infrastructure required to power any Web3 ecosystem. It provides applications with access to a wide range of on-chain data through a flexible and optimized interface. One well-known example is [**The Graph**](https://thegraph.com/en/), a popular blockchain indexer on Ethereum, which simplifies data availability for Web3 applications.

# Indexing Data

## Real-Time Data

Maestro’s blockchain indexer is specifically optimized for [**UTXO**](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/eutxo-explainer)** ledger primitives** and focuses on delivering both **real-time data liveness** and **data accuracy**. Blockchains operate as an **event-driven system** with probabilistic transaction finality, meaning the ledger’s "ground truth" isn't instantly finalized—it can take some time to reach global consensus.

</Note>

Accessing “real-time” onchain data requires rigorous data integrity checks. Traditional solutions, like adding a **block buffer** to indexers, only mitigate rollbacks by providing outdated data.

Maestro has designed a system that handles rollbacks gracefully and in **real-time**, giving users live data without sacrificing data integrity. Let's take a closer look at the components that make up the indexer:

1. **Indexer** - Specialized pipelines that extract, match, and process on-chain information, including handling rollbacks.
2. **Storage** - A data lake optimized for storing various types of data.
3. **Access** - A REST API providing flexible and performant querying capabilities.

## Common Use Cases

Accurate and live on-chain data is critical for delivering an optimal user experience in blockchain applications. Some common use cases  for blockchain indexers include:

- **Smart contract-based dApps** – Time-sensitive DeFi apps like DEXs, NFT marketplaces, lending protocols, games, and metaverses.
- **Wallets and Decentralized IDs (DIDs)** – Real-time UTxO states are crucial for Cardano wallets, cross-chain wallets, and DID systems.
- **Blockchain explorers** – Analytics platform require reliable access to large sets of on-chain data.
- **Bridges & Web2 integrations** – Blockchain bridges and integrations with traditional Web2 software require access to on-chain information.
