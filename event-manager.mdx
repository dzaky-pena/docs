title: Event Manager
---

*Real-time event notification systems* are a game-changer for developers building **responsive, reactive applications.** Instead of "pull-based" APIs requiring the client to explicitly request data from the blockchain, "push-based" APIs automatically send data to a client as soon as certain events happen on-chain.

Leading to:

1. Significant savings in API usage and billing
2. Increased app responsiveness with better user experience.

**Maestro's Event Manager** is a *blockchain event notification service* that monitors the blockchain network for user-specified events and notifies applications in real-time via *Webhooks*.

This allows applications to stay updated with on-chain activities such as:

- **Wallet Event:** Track wallet deposits and withdraws
- **Token Activity:** Token transfers or NFT mints
- **Script Execution:** Execution of scripts and smart-contracts
- **Mempool State:** Pending transactions in the mempool
- **Network Activity:** New block minted or blockchain reorgs

## Mempool-Aware Event Notifications

**Maestro's Event Manager** has a unique feature in that it is "*mempool-aware"*. That means every configured Event Webhook has two types of notification:

1. **Mempool Notification**: Triggered when the event is detected in the mempool
2. **Onchain Notification**: Triggered when the event is first minted onchain (block confirmation = 1).

## Benefits of Event-Driven App Architecture

By subscribing to these notifications, developers can create applications that react instantly to blockchain activity, **improving user experience and enabling a variety of innovative functionalities.**

1. **Reduced Overhead:** Instead of constantly querying node data to check if something happened onchain, your app can rely on real-time push notifications, resulting in **significantly less API calls.**
2. **Real-time Experience:** Create a responsive app that immediately updates users with their most important events creating a **better user experience**. (e.g., “your NFT was just transferred!”)
3. **Scalability and Cost Savings:** Maestro's Event Manager handles the heavy lifting of monitoring the chain so your app never misses an important event. This results in **reduced infrastructure complexity and long-term cost savings**.

## How Does the Event Manager Work?

At a high level, here’s how the event notification service operates:

### Set up an Event Manager

Login to your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.gomaestro.org/login) and navigate to the **"Event"** page. You must first create an *Event Manager* by clicking on the "Create Webhook" button selecting which blockchain and network you want to track. There are two types of Trigger:

- **Transaction:** Filter events based on transaction information: hash, address, asset, etc.
- **Block:** Filter events based on block information: height, fee, block space, etc. (*currently not-available*)

</Frame>

<Note>
**Using the API Interface**
Create Event Manager: [`POST eventmanager.gomaestro-api.org/v0/managers`](/bitcoin/create-event-manager")
</Note>

### Setup Webhook

Configure a *Webhook endpoint URL* in your application where the notifications will be sent. This endpoint acts as a receiver for event data pushed by the Event Manager.

### Configure an Event Triggers

Event triggers must be configured to filter only events important to the application or end-user, such as wallet deposits or transactions processed. The following trigger filters are available.

</Frame>

<Note>
**Using the API Interface**
Create Event Trigger: [`POST eventmanager.gomaestro-api.org/v0/triggers`](/bitcoin/create-event-manager-trigger)
</Note>

### Processing Real-Time Notifications:

When the subscribed event occurs on-chain, the notification service sends a HTTP request (a “webhook”) to your specified endpoint (for example, [https://myapp.com/api/notifications](https://myapp.com/api/notifications)) with details about the event. Your application can process the incoming data to trigger workflows, update user interfaces, or store relevant information.

### Tracking Event Logs

Additionally, the Event Manager allows you to retrieve event log history that can be used for various purposes such as audit logs, trend analytics, and time-series charts.

<Note>
**Using the API Interface**
Retrieve Event Logs: [`GET eventmanager/logs/{id}`](/bitcoin/event-log-info-by-id)
</Note>

## Common Use Cases for Real-Time Event Notifications

### DeFi Protocol Monitoring

**Liquidity Pool Events**: Get alerts when large liquidity deposits or withdrawals occur, or if pool parameters change.
**Loan Liquidations:** Notify borrowers (or watchers) in real-time when a position is at risk or has been liquidated.

### NFT Marketplace & Collectibles

**Mint Tracking:** Monitor when new tokens are minted so you can update supply or notify users.
Transfer/Ownership Updates: Send push notifications when an NFT changes hands.
**Auction Bids:** Real-time updates for any new bids or final sales.

### Wallet & Portfolio Tracking

**Address Activity: **Keep track of inbound/outbound transactions for a user’s wallet. Helpful for generating push notifications.
**Token Balance Changes:** When an address receives a new token or sells a portion of a token.

### Transaction Lifecycle Tracking

**Pending → Mined → Confirmed:** Provide instant feedback to users about where their transaction is in the pipeline.
**Dropped or Replaced Transactions:** Notify users if their transaction was replaced by a new one with a higher fee.

### Security & Monitoring

**Smart Contract Exploit Detection:** Set up alerts for large, abnormal transactions on known vulnerable contracts.
**Whitelist/Blacklist:** Immediately know if a blacklisted address interacts with your protocol.
