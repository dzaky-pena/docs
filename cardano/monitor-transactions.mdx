title: Monitor Transactions
---

## Prerequisites

Before you start monitoring transactions, make sure you have:

- Created an Account
- Created a Project
- Access to the **Transactions** page on your Maestro dashboard.


## Overview

The **Transaction Manager & Monitoring System** enables you to track the entire lifecycle of all transactions submitted via the Maestro API. Stay updated on each transaction’s status—from pending in the mempool, to being accepted on-chain, rejected by a node, or rolled back by the network.

Real-time state change notifications are available via [Webhooks]() created on the platform Transaction page.

## Webhook Transaction Notifications

The webhook JSON payloads have the following schema:

    "block_number": 8115321,
    "metadata": {...}
}
```
